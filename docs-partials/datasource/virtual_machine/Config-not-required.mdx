- `name` (string) - Basic filter with glob support (e.g. `nginx_basic*`). Defaults to `*`.
  Using strict globs will not reduce execution time because vSphere API returns the full inventory.
  But can be used for better readability over regular expressions.

- `name_regex` (string) - Extended name filter with regular expressions support (e.g. `nginx[-_]basic[0-9]*`). Default is empty.
  The match of the regular expression is checked by substring. Use `^` and `$` to define a full string.
  E.g. the `^[^_]+$` filter will search names without any underscores.
  The expression must use [Go Regex Syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax).

- `template` (bool) - Filter to return only objects that are virtual machine templates.
  Defaults to `false` and returns all VMs.

- `node` (string) - Filter to search virtual machines only on the specified node.

- `vm_tags` ([]Tag) - Filter to return only that virtual machines that have attached all specifies tags.
  Specify one or more `vm_tags` blocks to define list of tags that will make up the filter.
  Should work since vCenter 6.7. To avoid incompatibility, REST client is being
  initialized only when at least one tag has been defined in the config.

- `latest` (bool) - This filter determines how to handle multiple machines that were matched with all
  previous filters. Machine creation time is being used to find latest.
  By default, multiple matching machines results in an error.
